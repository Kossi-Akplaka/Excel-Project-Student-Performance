# Empowering Academic Excellence By Analyzing Student Performance Across Disciplines: Project Overview
* Support informed decision-making: Analyzing student performance data helps educators, administrators, and policymakers make informed decisions about curriculum development, resource allocation, and intervention strategies. Identifying the percentage of students meeting specific performance goals (such as an 80% goal) can be vital in targeting areas that need improvement or additional support.
* Identify trends and patterns: By examining summary statistics across multiple disciplines, I uncover patterns or trends in student performance. This information can be used to inform best practices, design targeted interventions, or guide future research on educational methods and strategies.
* Measure effectiveness of programs: This project serves as a benchmark for measuring the effectiveness of various educational programs, curricula, or teaching methods. By comparing the percentage of students meeting the 80% goal before and after implementing changes, stakeholders can assess the impact of their initiatives on student performance.


## Problem Description:
* Utilizing school data, perform a comprehensive analysis of summary statistics across six key disciplines (Math, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Spanish, and Literature) to determine the percentage of students achieving an 80% or higher goal. 
* Each course has a distinct grading structure with assignments accounting for 20%, midterms contributing 30%, and finals representing 50% of the final grade. 
* Additionally, each discipline holds a specific credit weight (Math - 4, Physics - 4, Biology - 3, Chemistry - 2, Spanish - 2, Literature - 3), summing up to a total of 18 credits.


## Data and Packages
* Data available: https://nces.ed.gov/datalab/
* Packages: Excel Power Query, Excel pre-defined and complex formulas, Pivot Table, Conditional formatting


## Data Analysis
* Power Query to join 6 discipines tables into a single table 'Student Data'
* Power query to merge 'Student Data' table and Professors and Credits data
* Excel formulas (If, Count, conditional formatting, xlookup for search) to clean the data and find the average score, total weight score
* Pivot table to summarize the data and utilize calculated field to calculate to weighted mean score
* Complex Excel formula to find the percentage of students achieving the 80% goal
* Filter the data by Class to find the percentage of student underperforming in each class
